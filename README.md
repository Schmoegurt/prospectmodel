# NHL Prospect Evaluation Model

This is a repository that will store the data and code I used to build my Prospect
Evaluation Model (PEM). This is a model that will look at statistics of players
in feeder leagues for the NHL and predict the probability of that player becoming
a regular NHL player. The leagues included will be the KHL, Liiga, Mestis, SHL,
Allsvenskan, Czech Extraliga, OHL, QMJHL, WHL, NCAA, USHL, and USDP.

I will post more when the model is closer to being completed.
